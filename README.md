# Movie Recommendations Using Content-Based Filtering
This was another code set that was used to create a simple recommendation system based on the content-based filtering. Basically, a recommendation system is a continuous body of inforamtion that serves to make predictions and offer relevant options or items to the users.\
In this instance, the recommendation system was based on the content used for the selection of the movies. In this repository, the movies that were suggested was based on the content that was directed towards the user's preferences.

The codes as shown in this github repository is used to suggest movies based on the user's viewing content for movies till the year 2016. The training datasets can be added upon at any time to further improve matched suggestions. This work could also be extended to other sources of information as listed above.
